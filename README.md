This is a toy project to demonstrate that when project is planned well and limited in scope, that a lot can be accomplished in a short time.

Riggity Riggity Wrecked was completed in three evenings and it was my first experience with React and ES6.  It accomplished the target goal of making my co-workers giggle and functions as a rapid prototype of a concept with only a small time investment.

There was one known bug relating to the interaction between react-dnd and react-tooltip.  I like the game and want it working well so some small additional work was done after the three days to fix it.
